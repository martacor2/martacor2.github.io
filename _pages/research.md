# 1. Research Projects
<!-- My research interest lies at the intersection of lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), astrodynamics, spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control (GNC), and multi-agent systems. Below are the lists of research projects that I have worked on at Stanford University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and The University of Tokyo. -->
